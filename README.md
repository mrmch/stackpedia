stackpedia
==========

web tool to describe your "stack" dependencies with
(someday) pretty visualizations with d3js

I was motivated to build this partly from a personal 
desire for a way to visualize the software stacks I 
was using, as well as to attempt to give credit to 
the many developers behind the fantastic software 
I use every day.

I aspire to have stackpedia also perform some rudimentary 
license checks, because developers often over look open 
source licenses when they start pulling projects from 
github and other social coding sites.
